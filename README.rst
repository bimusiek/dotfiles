Useful Dotfiles
===============

check out to ``~/.dotfiles`` and symlink relevant files. don't checkout directly
to ``~`` cause otherwise all folders in HOME are recognized as git repo.

- change your ``.profile`` to https://github.com/pansen/dotfiles/blob/master/.profile
- open a new terminal window without closing the current one
- type ``which port`` to see if the exported ``PATH`` is working
- type ``export`` to see if the exported vars make sense
- close the other terminals to avoid confusion
- install ports you like (without ``sudo`` since all is in your ``HOME``)
